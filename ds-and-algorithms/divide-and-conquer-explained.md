# Divide and Conquer Explained
- **Core Concept:** A problem-solving paradigm that recursively divides a complex problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, conquers each subproblem individually, and then combines the solutions to resolve the original problem.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - **Divide:** Break down the problem into smaller, independent subproblems.
  - **Conquer:** Solve each subproblem recursively or directly.
  - **Combine:** Merge the solutions of the subproblems to form the final solution.

## Code Example
```ts
function mergeSort(data: number[]): number[] {
    if (data.length <= 1) return data; // Base case: already sorted

    const mid = Math.floor(data.length / 2);
    const left = mergeSort(data.slice(0, mid));
    const right = mergeSort(data.slice(mid));
    return merge(left, right); // Combine sorted sub-arrays
}

function merge(left: number[], right: number[]): number[] {
    const merged = [];
    let i = 0, j = 0;
    while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
        merged.push(left[i] <= right[j] ? left[i++] : right[j++]);
    }
    merged.push(...left.slice(i));
    merged.push(...right.slice(j));
    return merged;
}
```

## Code Explanation
1. **Divide:** `mergeSort` recursively divides the `data` array into halves until reaching single elements.
2. **Conquer:** Each sub-array is sorted through recursive calls to `mergeSort` or directly for base cases.
3. **Combine:** `merge` function iterates through sorted sub-arrays, merging them into a single sorted `merged` array.

## Common Errors and Prevention Strategies
- **Incomplete Division:** Failing to ensure subproblems are entirely independent might lead to incorrect solutions.
  - **Prevention:** Carefully define the division process to clearly separate subproblems.
- **Inefficient Conquer:** Choosing unsuitable methods for solving subproblems can impact performance.
  - **Prevention:** Analyze subproblems and select appropriate algorithms for efficiency.
- **Incorrect Combination:** Errors in merging solutions can lead to inaccurate final results.
  - **Prevention:** Implement reliable mechanisms for combining solved subproblems.

## Additional Notes
- **Variety of Algorithms:** Merge sort, quick sort, and [binary search](binary-search-explained.md) are popular examples of divide-and-conquer algorithms.
- **Applications:** Efficiently solving complex problems like sorting, searching, and game playing.
- **Trade-offs:** Can be overhead-intensive for small problems compared to simpler algorithms.
- **Choosing Divide and Conquer:** Consider problem complexity, subproblem independence, and available resources before applying.
