# Tail Call Optimization Explained
- **Core Concept:** A compiler optimization that transforms tail calls (functions whose last action is a call to another function) to avoid unnecessary stack frames, preventing stack overflow errors in deep recursions.
- **Requirements for TCO:**
    - Function calls itself as the last operation.
    - No further operations or calculations needed after the recursive call.

## Code Example
```ts
function factorialTCO(n: number, accumulator: number = 1): number {
    if (n === 0) {
        return accumulator; // Base case, return accumulated result
    } else {
        return factorialTCO(n - 1, n * accumulator); // Tail call: pass accumulated value
    }
}
```

## Code Explanation
1. **Tail Call:** The recursive call is the final action, making it eligible for TCO.
2. **Accumulator:** Stores intermediate results, avoiding stack growth.
3. **TCO-Friendly Structure:** Compiler can reuse the current stack frame for subsequent calls.

## Common Errors and Prevention Strategies:
- **Non-Tail Calls:** TCO won't apply if functions perform operations after recursive calls.
  - **Prevention:** Restructure code to ensure the recursive call is the last action.
- **Compiler/Interpreter Limitations:** Not all environments support TCO.
  - **Prevention:** Check for language/runtime support and consider alternative strategies (e.g., iterative solutions, trampolines).
- **Incorrect Assumptions:** TCO doesn't guarantee infinite recursion prevention.
  - **Prevention:** Always maintain a clear base case for termination.

## Additional Notes:
- **TCO Benefits:** Improved performance and memory efficiency for deep recursions.
- **Language Support:** Varies across languages and runtimes.
- **Alternative Solutions:** Iterative approaches, trampolines, or manual stack management can be used when TCO is unavailable.
- **Typical Uses:** Mutual recursion, tree traversals, state machines, functional programming paradigms.
